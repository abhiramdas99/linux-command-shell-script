- The sed command, which is an acronym for Stream Editor, is a command-line tool that allows Linux users to perform text-based operations on files and terminal outputs. Using sed, users can find and replace specific words in a text, display a certain section of the output, and edit text files without opening them.

- The three basic operations supported by the sed command are:

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Substitution (Find and replace)
